	intro = "Grand Central is a free, open source Clearly Magical Framework, with a unique write-less-do-more syntax. It's content agnostic, so you can develop a social network of humans, a blog of reviews or a bike shop. It's API-centered, so you can power a website, a mobile app or json services. It's pretty, so you want to use it. And it's made for devs too: you can chain your PHP just like in jQuery! It's social, so the content you're managing intertwines with the persons you're managing it with. It's user-abstract and event-based, so human can use it, but it also runs machine-to-machine businesses: you can have it connect your phone with your 3D printer.
Each release takes the name of a famous train station, handling passengers organically from their departure point to the end of their journey. 4.1.0 is called Taormina."
